I modified my version of the [Akka 2.0 <tt>akka-sample-remote</tt>](https://github.com/mslinn/akka-sample-remote) project in order to figure out how durable mailboxes work.

I tested with IntelliJ IDEA 11; included with this git project are 3 IDEA run configurations.
These run configurations launch the programs from <tt>target/scala-2.9.1-1/classes</tt> so <tt>application.conf</tt> and <tt>common.conf</tt> are found.
